# qu-challenge

This project was made with the Vue CLI, Vite, Pinia for state management and Fetch API for the API requests.

The main intent was to present a simple, yet cohesive UI with some data retreived from the Star Wars API.

Not much modifications from the default styles, as the idea was mostly to explore Pinia usage and component composition.

Sorting logic is explored on the state-saved data, as the API doesn't provide sorting parameters and providing a full-result sorting logic would require a full fetch of the results.
